Welcome to my new blog! This is a sample post to get things started. The blog is built with Astro[^1] and uses the beautiful Catppuccin color theme[^2] for a pleasant reading experience.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern static site generator that offers:

- Excellent performance
- Great developer experience
- Component-based architecture
- Zero JavaScript by default

## Testing Specific Markdown Things

```
This is text in a code block, I wonder...
```

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |
| Row 3, Col 1 | Row 3, Col 2 | Row 3, Col 3 |

This is some normal text.
